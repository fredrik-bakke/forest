\p{
  Covariant type families are inner.
}
\p{
  In other words, the inner horn inclusion is anodyne at the left end-point inclusion of the directed interval.
}

\proof{
  See Proposition 6.1.1 [[buchholtz-weinberger-2023]]. Thanks to Sam Toth for putting it to my attention that the proof that was previously here was incorrect.
}
