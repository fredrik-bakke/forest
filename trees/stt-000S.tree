\p{
  Given a type #{A}, then the type family
  ##{\hom(a, \blank) : A \to \universe{U}}
  is covariant for all #{a : A} if and only if #{A} is Segal.
}

\proof{
  Assume given directed edges #{f : \hom_A(x,y)} and #{g : \hom_A(y,z)}. The lifting condition of a covariant type family asks precisely that there is a unique lift

  \pre{\startverb
      hom(a,b)      hom(a,c)
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    │     │             │     │
    │   f ∙ ··········> │     │  hom(a,-)
    │     │             ∙     │
    │     │             │     │
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
          ↧             ↧
    ----- ∙ ——————————> ∙ -----      A
          b      g      c
  \stopverb}
  hence, by uncurrying, that we have a unique filler


  \tikzcd{
    a \arrow[d, "f"']\arrow[r, equals] & a \arrow[d, dotted]\\
    b \arrow[r, "g"'] & c\mathrlap{,}
  }
  so the result follows from the universal property of #{\Delta^2} as the directed cone over #{\directed-interval}.
